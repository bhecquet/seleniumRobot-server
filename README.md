# seleniumRobot-server #
Server that supports seleniumRobot executions
Features:
- serves variables for seleniumRobot tests
- store test results if requested
- store and compare snapshots if requested

# Build #
For now, build is done through the python script `build.py`. Ite generates a zip file which you only need to unzip

## Session / data cleaning ##

When selenium server records test results, it stores many data which fills the storage quickly
To avoid this, there is a django command to clean it regularly

```
python manage.py scheduler
```

This starts a scheduler (Django must already be started) which cleans data at regular interval

Configuration for the scheduler and cleaning process can be found in settings_base.py and can be overriden in settings.py

```
DELETE_STEP_REFERENCE_AFTER_DAYS = 30       # number of days after which old references will be deleted if they have not been updated. 30 days by default
COMPRESS_IMAGE_FOR_SUCCESS_AFTER_DAYS = 5   # number of days after which images of successful test (except step references and snapshot for comparison) will be compressed at 85%
COMPRESS_IMAGE_FOR_FAILURE_AFTER_DAYS = 10  # number of days after which images of failed test (except step references and snapshot for comparison) will be compressed at 85%
DELETE_HTML_FOR_SUCCESS_AFTER_DAYS = 5      # number of days after which HTML of successful test will be replaced by empty code
DELETE_HTML_FOR_FAILURE_AFTER_DAYS = 10     # number of days after which HTML of failed test will be replaced by empty code
DELETE_VIDEO_FOR_SUCCESS_AFTER_DAYS = 15    # number of days after which HTML of successful test will be deleted
CLEANING_CRON = "0 3 * * *"                 # clean every day at 3 a.m
```

This scheduler can be started as a service 

```
[Unit]
Description=Job scheduler for Selenium server
After=network.target selenium-server.service
Wants=selenium-server.service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=<install_dir>/venv/bin/python3 <install_dir>/manage.py scheduler
KillSignal=SIGCONT
PrivateTmp=true
User=apache
Group=apache

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

# Configuration # 

change settings accordingly into settings.py (replace `${var}` variables)

## Authentication ##

### AD / LDAP ###
to use AD/LDAP authentication, in `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`, 

- replace `${auth.backends}` by `seleniumRobotServer.ldapbackends.LDAPBackend1`
- configure the LDAP Authentication part

	AUTH_LDAP_1_SERVER_URI = "ldap://my.company.com:389"
	AUTH_LDAP_1_BIND_DN = 'CN=user,OU=branch,DC=my,DC=company,DC=com'
	AUTH_LDAP_1_BIND_PASSWORD = 'pwd'
	AUTH_LDAP_1_USER_SEARCH = LDAPSearch("DC=my,DC=company,DC=com", ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "(uid=%(user)s)")
	AUTH_LDAP_1_GROUP_SEARCH = LDAPSearch("DC=my,DC=company,DC=com", ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "(objectClass=group)")
	AUTH_LDAP_1_GROUP_TYPE = ActiveDirectoryGroupType()
	AUTH_LDAP_1_USER_FLAGS_BY_GROUP = {
	    "is_active": (LDAPGroupQuery("CN=GROUP_USER_001,OU=Selenium,DC=my,DC=company,DC=com") |
	                  LDAPGroupQuery("CN=GROUP_ADMIN_002,OU=Selenium,DC=my,DC=company,DC=com")),
	    "is_staff": "CN=GROUP_USER_001,OU=Selenium,DC=my,DC=company,DC=com",
	    "is_superuser": "CN=GROUP_ADMIN_002,OU=Selenium,DC=my,DC=company,DC=com"
	}

if you have several LDAP configuration, replace `${ldap.backends}` by `seleniumRobotServer.ldapbackends.LDAPBackend2", "seleniumRobotServer.ldapbackends.LDAPBackend3` 
You will also have to configure the 2 remaining LDAP `AUTH_LDAP_2_xxx` and `AUTH_LDAP_3_xxx` sets of variables

Setting the following only allow users belonging to the 2 groups to be considered as active. If you remove it, all authenticated user will be active.

	"is_active": (LDAPGroupQuery("CN=GROUP_USER_001,OU=Selenium,DC=my,DC=company,DC=com") |
	                  LDAPGroupQuery("CN=GROUP_ADMIN_002,OU=Selenium,DC=my,DC=company,DC=com")),

For more details about configuration refer to [https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### OpenID configuration ###

You can activate it by

- replacing `${auth.backends}` by  `mozilla_django_oidc.auth.OIDCAuthenticationBackend` (default behaviour, based on email) or `seleniumRobotServer.openidbackend.NameOIDCAB` (behaviour based on 'sub' / username). This backend also automatically configures access rights based on groups declared in 'acr' userinfo returned by openid server.
- configure OpenID configuration part

	OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID = 'seleniumserver'
	OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET = 'secret'
	OIDC_OP_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT = "https://endpoint/oauth2/authorization"
	OIDC_OP_TOKEN_ENDPOINT = "https://endpoint/oauth2/token"
	OIDC_OP_USER_ENDPOINT = "https://endpoint/oauth2/userInfo"
	OIDC_RP_SIGN_ALGO = "RS256"
	OIDC_RP_SCOPES = "sub" # may not be necessary if email is provided
	OIDC_USE_NONCE = False # may be set to True if needed
	OIDC_RP_IDP_KEYFILE = 'key.pem' # pem file to read public key from. Only necessary for RS256 algo
	if os.path.isfile(OIDC_RP_IDP_KEYFILE):
	    with(open(OIDC_RP_IDP_KEYFILE)) as keyfile:
	        OIDC_RP_IDP_SIGN_KEY = keyfile.read()
	
	LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "/accounts/login/?next=/snapshot/"
	LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "/snapshot/"
	LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL_FAILURE = "/accounts/login/?next=/snapshot/"

	# to use in conjunction with 'NameOIDCAB' backend
	OIDC_IS_STAFF_GROUP_NAMES = ['User']
	OIDC_IS_SUPERUSER_GROUP_NAMES = ['Admin']
	

## Database ##
to use SQLite instead of Postgre: comment the right default database in `DATABASES`

## Field detector ##

Field detector feature is used to detect fields (text fields, buttons, ...) on pictures.
Computing is done for each reference picture and when '/detect' endpoint is called

To enable, you have to 
- configure one or several compute nodes ([https://github.com/bhecquet/image-fields-detector] (https://github.com/bhecquet/image-fields-detector)
- install a redis server
- in settings.py, update configuration

```
DRAMATIQ_BROKER['OPTIONS']['url'] = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
DRAMATIQ_RESULT_BACKEND['BACKEND_OPTIONS']['url'] = 'redis://localhost:6379'
```
- enable field detector: `FIELD_DETECTOR_ENABLED = 'True'`


# Usage #

## Security aspects ##

Before version 3.1, only variable server was secured, other accesses were open.
Now, you can enable/disable security on API / Web views through `SECURITY_API_ENABLED` and `SECURITY_WEB_ENABLED` parameter in settings.py.
Set it to `True` to restrict access to API / GUI

### Access with security enabled ###

As setting `SECURITY_WEB_ENABLED` and `SECURITY_API_ENABLED` to `True` will restrict all accesses, you must grant some users to access the server.

- execute `python manage.py fix_permissions` to create `Variable Users` and `Snapshot Users` groups
- If using AD/LDAP authentication or OpenID, authenticated users will automatically be added to the above groups
- Else, add them manually
- Add, as administrator an auth token to the user

![](doc/images/add_token.png)
- alternatively, you can create token through API (for example via Postman)
![](doc/images/generate_token_postman.png)

### Groups ###

#### Variable Users ####
Allow a user to add / modify variable assets, and also delete variables

#### Snapshot Users ####
Allow a user to view / add / edit snapshot comparisons

### Restrict access to a specific application ###

Setting `RESTRICT_ACCESS_TO_APPLICATION_IN_ADMIN` to `'True'` allow to restrict variable / result access to a specific application
In this case, one needs to grant permission on application basis. 

There are 2 permission sets
- permissions related to variables and result recording: 'can view application and related variable and version for xxx'
- permissions related to result viewing: 'can view results for xxx'

## User interface ##

### Variable Server ###
To access variable server go to `http://<server>:<port>/admin/`
Depending on your rights, you will be able to configure only variable server assets (application, test case, environment, variable and version) with `Variable Users` group or anything with admin rights

![](doc/images/home.png)

for each type of asset, behaviour is the same:

#### consult list of assets ####
Click on the asset type to access its list

![](doc/images/variable_list.png)

#### edit asset ####
From there, click on one of the variable to modify it

![](doc/images/edit_variable.png)

#### filter list ####
Because there may be plenty of variables for your test, you can filter by application, version, environment, ...
Display will take this filter into account to reduce the number of variables displayed

![](doc/images/filter.png)

It's also possible to search for some variable
**Search is done in name and value of variables**

#### add an asset ####

Clicking on `Add <asset>` allow you to create a new asset 

![](doc/images/add_variable.png)
From there, it's also possible to add some dependencies. For example, if your variable is associated to a new TestCase, create it from this screen

##### specific to variables #####

- *reservable*: means that several variable (same name, environment, version, ...) can be defined with different values. Fro example, you have a username that cannot be used by several test scripts at the same time. So you define multiple username for that environment/application. Then, seleniumRobot reserve on of this username so it cannot be used by other tests. When test ends, this variable is released (or after 15 mins by default)
- *internal*: this variable has been created by seleniumRobot for internal use. **Do not edit**
- *protected*: value should not be displayed to non admin users or users that do not have the `Can see protected vars` right (e.g: passwords)


#### Define dependencies between applications ####

In case your seleniumRobot test navigates through multiple application (app1 -> app2 -> app1), it may be useful to get variables from app2 at the same time as variables from app1.
To do so, in "app1" configuration, select the 'linkedApplication' => 'app2'

In seleniumRobot, variables from 'app2' will then be accessible with `param("app2.myVar")`

### Snapshot server ###

This server aims at storing test snapshots to compare them
Snapshot are sent by seleniumRobot when `seleniumRobotServerActive` and `seleniumRobotServerCompareSnapshots` are set to `true`. Moreover, only snapshot taken explicitely inside test script are sent to server

```java
capturePageSnapshot(<pic_name>, SnapshotCheckType.TRUE);
```
or

```java
captureElementSnapshot(<pic_name>, <myWebElement>, SnapshotCheckType.TRUE);
```

#### Access web interface ####

Go to [http://<server>:<port>/snapshot/](http://localhost:8002/snapshot/) and select the application / version and "compare snapshot"

![](doc/images/snapshot_select_session.png)

#### Visualize comparison results ####

Complete "environment", "sessions", "browser", "test cases" and execution date. Each time, click on "Filter".

You will then get a list of test sessions corresponding to your search criteria.

![](doc/images/snapshot_comparison_result.png)

these results will also be accessible from SeleniumRobot HTML result, as a tab in each test result, pointing to this page.

#### Edit comparison ####

For each picture, where a reference exists, a comparison pixel by pixel is done, meaning that picture size must be the same. Each pixel different from reference is coulored red. If these pixels are not relevant differences (value of a text field, picture based on news), then you can create "exclude zones" by clicking "Edit" button.

In the opened modal, draw rectangles and click "save". Differences are automatically recomputed.

On the bottom of the edit modal, you will find a table with all "exclude zones". You can disable some of them if you want them not being used anymore in comparison.

![](doc/images/snapshot_edit_exclude_zone.png)

**Exclude zones** are common to all pictures that share the same reference.

**Reference**: a picture to which further snapshot taken during test will be compared. A reference is specific to an [application / version / environment / test case / test step].

#### Change reference ####

By default, the first snapshot of a [application / version / environment / test case / test step] tuple is the reference. But sometimes, while application change, inside the same version, GUI may change and so, a new reference must be set. Therefore, you can click on button  "Make reference".

![](doc/images/snapshot_reference.png)

In the example above, firstly, all sessions snapshot refere to "reference" snapshot. But after making "Session 2" a new reference, "Session 1" always referes to "reference" while sessions after "Session 2" refere to "Sessions 2".


## API ##

Usage is the same for all API (example for version)
- `GET http://<server>:<port>/commons/api/version/2/` => get version by id
- `POST http://<server>:<port>/commons/api/version/` => add version. Request data should contain all mandatory fields
- `PATCH http://<server>:<port>/commons/api/version/2/` => change version by id. Request data should contain only updated fields
- `PUT http://<server>:<port>/commons/api/version/2/` => change version by id. Request data should contain all fields
- `DELETE http://<server>:<port>/commons/api/version/2/` => delete the version by id

### commons ###

- `/commons/api/gversion/?name=<>`: get version by name
- `/commons/api/gapplication/?name=<>`: get application by name
- `/commons/api/genvironment/?name=<>`: get environment by name
- `/commons/api/gtestcase/?name=<>`: get test case by name
- `/commons/api/version/`: get/post version by id
- `/commons/api/application/`: get/post application by id
- `/commons/api/environment/`: get/post environment by id
- `/commons/api/testcase/`: get/post test case by id


### variables ###

#### get all variables ####

To get variables from server: `http://<server>:<port>/variable/api/variable?version=7&environment=1&test=8&format=json`

Ids can be found through user interface. 

`format=json` is mandatory so that getting variable list is not done twice, thus reserving variables twice

#### create variable ####

	POST http://<server>:<port>/variable/api/variable?name=<name>&value=<value>&reservable=<true_or_false>&environment=<env_id>&application=<app_id>&internal=<true_or_false>&timeToLive=<time_to_live_in_days>
	
- `name`: name of the variable
- `value`: value assigned to variable
- `reservable`: (optional) if true, variable will be reserved by server when getting the list. This means that during 15 minutes, it won't be usable for other test if not released
- `timeToLive`: (optional) if value is greater than 0, variable will be destroyed after N days
- `environment`: (optional) id of the environment this variable is assigned to
- `application`: (optional) id of the application this variable is assigned to
- `version`: (optional) id of the version this variable is assigned to
- `test`: (optional) id of the test case this variable is assigned to
- `internal`: (optional) true or false. If true, indicates that this variable has been created by test scenarios for reuse only. These are not test datav
#### get only old variable ####

It's possible to get variables older than X days using olderThan parameter:

	GET http://<server>:<port>/variable/api/variable?version=7&environment=1&test=8&olderThan=2&format=json

This is useful when robot creates variables during a test, for reuse in an other one and created variable cannot be used directly. Concrete case:

- you create a user
- store this user id in variable server, but your application won't allow you to consult this user immediately (e.g: it needs some batch to be fully integrated in database)
- have a test that needs a valid user, created some days before

#### destroy temp variables automatically ####

When test creates variables, it may be useful to destroy these variables after some time to avoid a database growth.
You can set a time to live to a variable using the `destroyAfterDays` parameterng
